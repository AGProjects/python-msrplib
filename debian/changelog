  * made all the library classes new-style (derive from object)
  * replaced TrafficLogger and StateLogger with a single Logger class
  * fixed typo in AcceptorDirect.getHost()
  * made MSRPData.status property return StatusHeader instance, not a tuple
  * fixed MSRPTransport.make_chunk() to support REPORT requests
  * made ByteRangeHeader.decoded return a tuple instead of a list
  * made MSRPSession fire a success report if needed
  * test system: a few minor improvements
  * added unit test for success reports
  * fixed typo in MSRPTransport that made incoming chunks larger than 16K fail with ChunkParseError
  * fixed AttributeError in cleanup() methods
  * added __repr__ to connectors
  * limit debug log messages' length
  * set the timeout to 30 seconds

  * added a few docstrings
  * renamed 'sync' argument into 'wait' in all methods where it's used
  * added copy() method to protocol.MSRPData
  * fixed bug in MSRPTransport.read_chunk's incoming chunk splitting functionality:
    virtual chunks had incorrect Byte-Range header
  * made session actually pass INCOMING_CHUNK_SIZE to transport's read_chunk and thus split the incoming chunks
  * added support for sending files with MSRPSession: session.OutgoingFile class and MSRPSession.send_file() method
  * added examples for sending and receiving a message
  * added example for file transfer
  * updated eventlet dependency to 0.8.10

python-msrplib (0.9.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * splitted MSRPTransport into 2 classes: MSRPSession (session.py) and
    MSRPTransport (transport.py);
  * new MSRPSession class has outgoing queue and shutdown() method
  * added option to rechunk incoming chunks (generate sequence of small chunks
    from a big chunk)
  * transport.py: replaced make_SEND_response with make_response that also handles
  * non-SEND requests
  * added MSRPServer class with tests which reuse listening socket
  * made MSRPTransport.write_response accept 'sync' argument
  * made MSRPTransport.__init__ accept None as local_uri
  * connectors don't accept MSRPTransportClass anymore as an argument
  * added throw_args to MSRPTimeoutError.timeout() function
  * added __hash__ to protocol.URI; makes it usable in sets
  * used 'sync' argument to loseConnection instead of spawning a greenlet
  * added support for simple patterns to MSRPSession's accept_types argument
  * renamed MSRPSession's argument allowed_content_types to accept_types
  * changed MSRPSession to report incoming chunks and responses via a callback
  * added GreenMSRPSession class that builts on top of MSRPSession and uses a
    queue (like old MSRPSession)
  * protocol.py: added 'status' attribute to MSRPData
  * protocol.py: added 'code' and 'comment' attributes to StatusHeader
  * make MSRPTransport.write support 'sync' parameter like GreenTransportBase does
  * MSRPSession.send_chunk now accepts message_id parameter
  * MSRPSession.deliver_chunk now raises an exception if error code is not 200
  * made LocalResponse a subclass of MSRPTransactionError
  * added message_id argument to MSRPTransport.make_chunk
  * added optional 'sync' argument to cleanup()
  * updated copyright years
  * MSRPTransport: if an error, don't wait for connection to close before raising
  * made MSRPTransport.make_chunk accept start, end and length as arguments
  * connect.py: made somefunctions to use explicit params instead of kwargs where
    it adds clarity
  * connect.py: updated __all__ to include all the exceptions classes
  * added module docstring for connect.py
  * added byte_range attribute to MSRPData
  * added 'fro', 'to' and 'total' attributes to ByteRangeHeader
  * trafficlog.py: use sys.__stdout__ instead of saving stdout to a global var
  * added debug parameter to StateLogger
  * removed util.py
  * use random.getrandbits to generate random strings instead of /dev/urandom and
    custom functions
  * updated python-eventlet debian dependency from 0.8.9 to 0.8.9-2
  * added python-zopeinterface to dependecies
  * StateLogger: add dbg() method for writing arbitratry debug strings
  * made MSRPData.__repr__ more informative
  * made tests use whatever port is available, not necessarily 2855
  * added 'reserved session' log message to state logger
  * minor improvements in log messages
  * removed MSRPAcceptFactory and MSRPConnectFactory classes
  * added get_connector/get_acceptor functions
  * removed blocking operations from 'finally' and 'except' sections where they
    could result in traceback being delayed or missed
  * made connect.py more selective in catching exceptions, so it'll less likely
  * silent an error
  * added 'message_id' property to MSRPData
  * removed a debugging assert from trafficlog.py
